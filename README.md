I am a dedicated student with a deep passion for digital defense, sparked by a personal experience with data theft at age 14. Currently, I am completing the <b>Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate</b> while balancing A-Level studies in IT, Business, and Italian. I focus on the intersection of technical security, organizational protocols, and international cybercrime trends.
